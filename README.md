## Lab instruction
You can either run the Jupyter Notebook for the lab locally and use the Google Colab [online]().
To run the lab locally, it is recommended that you create a virtual environment with [Conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-with-commands) and install relevant libraries.

Once Conda is installed, run the following in the command line.
```bash
conda create -n qcphys python=3.11
conda activate qcphys
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
